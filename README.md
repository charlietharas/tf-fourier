Using FFT algorithm to show frequency/amplitude distribution of wav files in a music-visualizer fashion.

Messy WIP. Slowly getting into tangible state.

## branches
**python** contains the python source code and resource files used by it. This is currently the most advanced branch.

**octave** contains octave matlab source code used for prototyping and experimenting. This branch is generally stale and not under development.
