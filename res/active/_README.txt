Instructions for the program to work (currently in development phase):
- Place/replace a wav file you want to visualize into the res/active folder. It MUST be named active.wav. You can just rename it if necessary.
- Provided FFT.py runs visualize(), run FFT.py (otherwise just call visualize() somehow)
