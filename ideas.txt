TF-Fourier

Ideas & Notes
Principles of the project: 
- determine a 0-1 scalar metric defined by statistical analysis of fourier transform of a music file
- specifically:
	- program can analyze the single graph distribution of the fourier transform of the entire file, but computationally this is costly and takes a long time to crunch
	- program can analyze distributions of slivers of the file
		- can also analyze differences between slivers (ie what wavelengths go up over 20ms intervals)
		- can analyze median wavelength to get a vector of the song's pitch
		- can analyze optima to get a simplified picture of the song's travel path
		- (can also analyze derivative optima: ie where the pitch changes the most per sliver)
- using this "objective" metric AND analyses the ML aspect of the program can then build on it to construct its own model of song differences AND/OR to classify songs into different genres
	based on their fourier analysis
	
More ideas may be jotted down, but these are just some basic notes.
Project progress expected to be slow, but eventually will no longer be static and work will resume.
Also expect transition (or at least prototype) of components in Octave.
